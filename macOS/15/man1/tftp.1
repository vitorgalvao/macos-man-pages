TFTP(1)                     General Commands Manual                    TFTP(1)

NAME
     tftp – trivial file transfer program

SYNOPSIS
     tftp [host [port]]

DESCRIPTION
     The tftp utility is the user interface to the Internet TFTP (Trivial File
     Transfer Protocol), which allows users to transfer files to and from a
     remote machine.  The remote host may be specified on the command line, in
     which case tftp uses host as the default host for future transfers (see
     the connect command below).

     The optional -e argument sets the blocksize to the largest supported
     value and enables the TFTP timeout option as if the tout command had been
     given.  In previous versions of tftp, it also enabled binary mode and the
     TFTP blksize option; these are now on by default.

COMMANDS
     Once tftp is running, it issues the prompt “tftp>” and recognizes the
     following commands:

     ? command-name ...
              Print help information.

     ascii    Shorthand for "mode ascii"

     binary   Shorthand for "mode binary"

     blocksize [size]
              Sets the TFTP blksize option in TFTP Read Request or Write
              Request packets to [size] as specified in RFC 2348.  Valid
              values are between 8 and 65464.  If no blocksize is specified,
              then by default a blocksize of 512 bytes will be used.

     blocksize2 [size]
              Sets the TFTP blksize2 option in TFTP Read Request or Write
              Request packets to [size].  Values are restricted to powers of 2
              between 8 and 32768.  This is a non-standard TFTP option.

     connect host [port]
              Set the host (and optionally port) for transfers.  Note that the
              TFTP protocol, unlike the FTP protocol, does not maintain
              connections between transfers; thus, the connect command does
              not actually create a connection, but merely remembers what host
              is to be used for transfers.  You do not have to use the connect
              command; the remote host can be specified as part of the get or
              put commands.

     debug level
              Enable or disable debugging levels during verbose output.  The
              value of level can be one of packet, simple, options, or access.

     get [host:]file [localname]
     get [host1:]file1 [host2:]file2 ... [hostN:]fileN
              Get one or more files from the remote host.  When using the host
              argument, the host will be used as default host for future
              transfers.  If localname is specified, the file is stored
              locally as localname, otherwise the original filename is used.
              Note that it is not possible to download two files at a time,
              only one, three, or more than three files, at a time.

              To specify an IPv6 numeric address for a host, wrap it using
              square brackets like “[3ffe:2900:e00c:ffee::1234]:file” to
              disambiguate the colons used in the IPv6 address from the colon
              separating the host and the filename.

     mode transfer-mode
              Set the mode for transfers; transfer-mode may be one of ascii or
              binary.  The default is binary.

     packetdrop [arg]
              Randomly drop arg out of 100 packets during a transfer.  This is
              a debugging feature.

     put file [[host:]remotename]
     put file1 file2 ... fileN [[host:]remote-directory]
              Put a file or set of files to the remote host.  When remotename
              is specified, the file is stored remotely as remotename,
              otherwise the original filename is used.  If the
              remote-directory argument is used, the remote host is assumed to
              be a UNIX machine.  To specify an IPv6 numeric address for a
              host, see the example under the get command.

     options [arg]
              Enable or disable support for TFTP options.  The valid values of
              arg are on (enable RFC 2347 options), off (disable RFC 2347
              options), and extra (toggle support for non-RFC defined
              options).

     quit     Exit tftp.  An end of file also exits.

     rexmt retransmission-timeout
              Set the per-packet retransmission timeout, in seconds.

     rollover [arg]
              Specify the rollover option in TFTP Read Request or Write
              Request packets.  After 65535 packets have been transmitted, set
              the block counter to arg.  Valid values of arg are 0 and 1.
              This is a non-standard TFTP option.

     status   Show current status.

     timeout total-transmission-timeout
              Set the total transmission timeout, in seconds.

     trace    Toggle packet tracing.

     verbose  Toggle verbose mode.

     windowsize [size]
              Sets the TFTP windowsize option in TFTP Read Request or Write
              Request packets to [size] blocks as specified in RFC 7440.
              Valid values are between 1 and 65535.  If no windowsize is
              specified, then the default windowsize of 1 block will be used.

HISTORY
     The tftp command appeared in 4.3BSD.

     Edwin Groothuis <edwin@FreeBSD.org> performed a major rewrite of the
     tftpd(8) and tftp code to support RFC2348.

NOTES
     Because there is no user-login or validation within the TFTP protocol,
     the remote site will probably have some sort of file-access restrictions
     in place.  The exact methods are specific to each site and therefore
     difficult to document here.

     Files larger than 33488896 octets (65535 blocks) cannot be transferred
     without client and server supporting the TFTP blocksize option (RFC2348),
     or the non-standard TFTP rollover option.
