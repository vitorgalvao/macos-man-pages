DESCRIPTION
     The dyld_info tool will display information that dyld uses from binaries.
     It supports fixups information encoded as opcode based or as chained
     fixups.

     If the tool is run with no options, it defaults to the common options
     (-platform -segments -linked_dylibs).

     The tool can be run with paths to dylibs that are in the dyld cache and
     not on disk.

     The options are as follows:

     -arch arch
             Only display the specified architecture.  Other architectures in
             a universal image are ignored.

     -platform
             Display the platform (e.g. macOS, iOS) that the binary was built
             for.

     -segments
             Display all segments and sections with size info.

     -linked_dylibs
             Display all dylibs that the binary is linked against.

     -inits  Display all static initializers and Objective-C +load methods.

     -exports
             Display all exported symbols.

     -imports
             Display all imported symbols.

     -objc   Display the Objective-C classes and categories defined.

     -fixups
             Display a simple table of fixup locations and what dyld will set
             them to.

     -fixup_chains
             If the binary uses chained fixups, displays the format of the
             chains and the starts.

     -fixup_chain_details
             Display a table of all the raw fixup chain bits and their
             meanings.

     -function_starts
             Display the offset of all functions starts and their name.

     -symbolic_fixups
             Display all fixups, grouped by data symbol.

     -opcodes
             Display all the opcodes used to generate the rebase and binding
             information.

     -uuid   Display the UUID of the binary.

     -disassemble
             Display a disassemble of all code sections.

     -section segment-name section-name
             Display content of specified section.  Content is formatted if
             the content type is known.

     -all_sections
             Display content of all sections.  Content is formatted if the
             content type is known.

     -section_bytes segment-name section-name
             Display content of specified section as hex bytes.

     -all_sections_bytes
             Display content of all sections as hex bytes.

     -validate_only
             Display nothing if binary is valid, or information about what
             parts are malformed.

     -no_validate
             Skip validation before inspecting binary.

     -all_dir directory
             Will start at specified directory, recursively scan, and run
             dyld_info on each file found.

     -all_dyld_cache
             Will run dyld_info on every dylib in the dyld cache.
