SHAZAM-SIGNATURE(1)         General Commands Manual        SHAZAM-SIGNATURE(1)



NAME
     shazam signature â€“ Create shazam signature files from media


SYNOPSIS
     shazam signature [--input input] [--output output]



DESCRIPTION
     This command is used for manipulating and generating shazam signatures
     from a media input. The input can either be audio, video or a shazam
     signature. If the input is an audio file, the audio is converted into a
     shazam signature and saved to a specified output location. If the input
     is a video file, the video file has its audio extracted and converted to
     a shazam signature file. The combination of the start, duration and
     stride options can be used to remove unwanted audio at the beginning and
     slice the generated signature into smaller signatures. The stride defines
     the separation, in seconds, between consecutive slices. If the stride is
     smaller than the duration the slices will overlap. A starting offset can
     be applied to skip unwanted audio at the begining of the signature. The
     output must be a directory. If none is specified the current one will be
     used.


OPTIONS
     -i,--input input
             Path to an audio or video file to generate a shazam signature
             from.


     -o,--start start
             Apply a starting offset, in seconds, to skip unwanted audio at
             the beginning of the signature.


     -o,--duration duration
             Duration, in seconds, for each of the sliced signatures.


     -o,--stride stride
             Separation, in seconds, between consecutive slices.


     -o,--output output
             Path to save the new shazam signature file. If output is a
             directory, the shazam signature is created in that directory with
             the same name as the input file. If output is not specified, the
             shazam signature is saved in the current working directory with
             the same name as the input file.
