LOGGER(1)                   General Commands Manual                  LOGGER(1)

NAME
     logger – make entries in the system log

SYNOPSIS
     logger [-is] [-f file] [-p pri] [-t tag] [message ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The logger utility provides a shell command interface to the syslog(3)
     system log module.

     The following options are available:

     -i      Log the process id of the logger process with each line.  This
             flag is ignored and the process id is always logged.

     -s      Log the message to standard error, as well as the system log.

     -f file
             Read the contents of the specified file into syslog.  This option
             is ignored when a message is also specified.

     -p pri  Enter the message with the specified priority.  The priority may
             be specified numerically or as a facility.level pair.  For
             example, “-p local3.info” logs the message(s) as informational
             level in the local3 facility.  The default is “user.notice”.

     -t tag  Mark every line in the log with the specified tag rather than the
             default of current login name.

     message
             Write the message to log; if not specified, and the -f flag is
             not provided, standard input is logged.

EXIT STATUS
     The logger utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
           logger System rebooted

           logger -p local0.notice -t HOSTIDM -f /dev/idmc

     compatible.
