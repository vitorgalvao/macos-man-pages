UNITS(1)                    General Commands Manual                   UNITS(1)

NAME
     units – conversion calculator

SYNOPSIS
     units [-ehqtUVv] [-f unitsfile] [-o format] [from to]

DESCRIPTION
     The units program converts quantities expressed in various scales to
     their equivalents in other scales.  It can only handle multiplicative or
     affine scale changes.

     units can work interactively by prompting the user for input (see
     EXAMPLES) or non-interactively, providing a conversion for given
     arguments from and to.

     The following options are available:

     -e, --exponential
              Same as -o %6e (see the description of the -o flag).

     -f unitsfile, --file unitsfile
              Specify the name of the units data file to load.  This option
              may be specified multiple times.

     -H historyfile, --history historyfile
              Ignored, for compatibility with GNU units.

     -h, --help
              Show an overview of options.

     -o format, --output-format format
              Select the output format string by which numbers are printed.
              Defaults to “%.8g”.

     -q, --quiet
              Suppress prompting of the user for units and the display of
              statistics about the number of units loaded.

     -t, --terse
              Only print the result.  This is used when calling units from
              other programs for easy to parse results.

     -U, --unitsfile
              Print the location of the default unit file if it exists.
              Otherwise, print an error message.

     -v, --version
              Print the version number (which is fixed at “FreeBSD units”),
              the path to the units data file and exit.

     -V, --verbose
              Print the units in the conversion output.  Be more verbose in
              general.

     from to  Allow a single unit conversion to be done directly from the
              command line.  The program will not print prompts.  It will
              print out the result of the single specified conversion.  Both
              arguments, i.e., from and to, can be just a unit (e.g., “cm”), a
              quantity (e.g., “42”), or a quantity with a unit (e.g., “42 cm”)

   Mathematical operators
     -   Powers of units can be specified using the “^” character as shown in
         the example, or by simple concatenation: “cm3” is equivalent to
         “cm^3”.  See the BUGS section for details on the limitations of
         exponent values.
     -   Multiplication of units can be specified by using spaces (“ ”), a
         dash (“-”) or an asterisk (“*”).
     -   Division of units is indicated by the slash (“/”).
     -   Division of numbers must be indicated using the vertical bar (“|”).

     Note that multiplication has a higher precedence than division, so
     “m/s/s” is the same as “m/s^2” or “m/s s”.

   Units
     The conversion information is read from a units data file.  The default
     file includes definitions for most familiar units, abbreviations and
     metric prefixes.  Some constants of nature included are:

           pi         ratio of circumference to diameter
           c          speed of light
           e          charge on an electron
           g          acceleration of gravity
           force      same as g
           mole       Avogadro's number
           water      pressure per unit height of water
           mercury    pressure per unit height of mercury
           au         astronomical unit

     The unit “pound” is a unit of mass.  Compound names are run together so
     “pound force” is a unit of force.  The unit “ounce” is also a unit of
     mass.  The fluid ounce is “floz”.  British units that differ from their
     US counterparts are prefixed with “br”, and currency is prefixed with its
     country name: “belgiumfranc”, “britainpound”.  When searching for a unit,
     if the specified string does not appear exactly as a unit name, then
     units will try to remove a trailing “s” or a trailing “es” and check
     again for a match.

   Units file format
     To find out what units are available read the standard units file.  If
     you want to add your own units you can supply your own file.  A unit is
     specified on a single line by giving its name and an equivalence.  Be
     careful to define new units in terms of old ones so that a reduction
     leads to the primitive units which are marked with “!” characters.  The
     units program will not detect infinite loops that could be caused by
     careless unit definitions.  Comments in the unit definition file begin
     with a “#” or “/” character at the beginning of a line.

     Prefixes are defined in the same way as standard units, but with a
     trailing dash (“-”) at the end of the prefix name.  If a unit is not
     found even after removing trailing “s” or “es”, then it will be checked
     against the list of prefixes.  Prefixes will be removed until a legal
     base unit is identified.

ENVIRONMENT
     PATH  The colon-separated list of root directories at which units tries
           to find /usr/share/misc/definitions.units.

           For example if PATH is set to “/tmp:/:/usr/local”, no -f flags are
           provided, and /usr/share/misc/definitions.units is missing then
           units tries to open the following files as the default units file:
           /tmp/usr/share/misc/definitions.units,
           /usr/share/misc/definitions.units, and
           /usr/local/usr/share/misc/definitions.units.

FILES
     /usr/share/misc/definitions.units  The standard units file.

EXIT STATUS
     The units utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1: Simple conversion of units

       This example shows how to do simple conversions, for example from
       gigabytes to bytes:

         $ units -o %0.f -t '4 gigabytes' bytes
         4294967296

       The -o %0.f part of the command is required to print the result in a
       non-scientific notation (e.g, 4294967296 instead of 4.29497e+09).

     Example 2: Interactive usage

       Here is an example of an interactive session where the user is prompted
       for units:

         You have: meters
         You want: feet
                 * 3.2808399
                 / 0.3048

         You have: cm^3
         You want: gallons
                 * 0.00026417205
                 / 3785.4118

         You have: meters/s
         You want: furlongs/fortnight
                 * 6012.8848
                 / 0.00016630952

         You have: 1|2 inch
         You want: cm
                 * 1.27
                 / 0.78740157

         You have: 85 degF
         You want: degC
                 29.444444

     Example 3: Difference between “|” and “/” division

       The following command shows how to convert half a meter to centimeters.

         $ units '1|2 meter' cm
                 * 50
                 / 0.02

       units prints the expected result because the division operator for
       numbers (“|”) was used.

       Using the division operator for units (“/”) would result in an error:

         $ units '1/2 meter' cm
         conformability error
                 0.5 / m
                 0.01 m

       It is because units interprets “1/2 meter” as “0.5/meter”, which is not
       conformable to “cm”.

     Example 4: Simple units file
       Here is an example of a short units file that defines some basic units:

         m         !a!
         sec       !b!
         micro-    1e-6
         minute    60 sec
         hour      60 min
         inch      0.0254 m
         ft        12 inches
         mile      5280 ft

     Example 5: Viewing units and conversions of the default units file
       The following shell one-liner allows the user to view the contents of
       the default units file:

         $ less "$(units -U)"

DIAGNOSTICS
     can't find units file '%s'  The default units file is not in its default
     location (see FILES) and it is not present in any file tree starting with
     their roots at directories from PATH (see ENVIRONMENT).

     cap_rights_limit() failed  See capsicum(4).

     conformability error  It is not possible to reduce the given units to one
     common unit: they are not conformable.  Instead of a conversion, units
     will display the reduced form for each provided unit:

       You have: ergs/hour
       You want: fathoms kg^2 / day
       conformability error
               2.7777778e-11 kg m^2 / sec^3
               2.1166667e-05 kg^2 m / sec

     Could not initialize history  See editline(3).

     dupstr  strdup(3) failed.

     memory for prefixes exceeded in line %d  Over 100 prefixes were defined.

     memory for units exceeded in line %d  Over 1000 prefixes were defined.

     memory overflow in unit reduction  The requested conversion involves too
     many units (see BUGS).

     redefinition of prefix '%s' on line %d ignored

     redefinition of unit '%s' on line %d ignored

     unexpected end of prefix on line %d

     unexpected end of unit on line %d

     Units data file not found  The default units file is missing.

     unable to enter capability mode  See capsicum(4).

     unable to open units file '%s'  One of the user-specified units files
     cannot be opened.

     unit reduces to zero

     unknown unit '%s'  The provided unit cannot be found in the units file.

     WARNING: conversion of non-proportional quantities.  units may fail to
     convert from to to because the units are not proportional.  The warning
     is printed when a quantity is a part of the to argument.  It can be
     illustrated on an example of conversion from Fahrenheit to Celsius:

       $ units "degF" "degC"
                (-> x*0.55555556g -17.777778g)
                (<- y*1.8g 32g)
       $ units "degF" "1 degC"
       WARNING: conversion of non-proportional quantities.
                (-> x*0.55555556g -17.777778g)
                (<- y*1.8g 32g)
       $ units "1 degF" "1 degC"
       WARNING: conversion of non-proportional quantities.

BUGS
     The effect of including a “/” in a prefix is surprising.

     Exponents entered by the user can be only one digit.  You can work around
     this by multiplying several terms.

     The user must use “|” to indicate division of numbers and “/” to indicate
     division of symbols.  This distinction should not be necessary.

     The program contains various arbitrary limits on the length of the units
     converted and on the length of the data file.

     The program should use a hash table to store units so that it does not
     take so long to load the units list and check for duplication.

     It is not possible to convert a negative value.

     The units program does not handle reductions of long lists of units very
     well:

       $ units "$(yes m | head -n 154)" "$(yes cm | head -n 154)"
               * 1e+308
               / 1e-308
       $ units "$(yes m | head -n 333)" "$(yes cm | head -n 333)"
               * inf
               / 0
       $ units "$(yes m | head -n 500)" "$(yes cm | head -n 500)"
       units: memory overflow in unit reduction
       conformability error
               1 m^500
