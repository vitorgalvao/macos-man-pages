RSYNCD(5)                     File Formats Manual                    RSYNCD(5)

NAME
     rsyncd – rsyncd wire protocol

DESCRIPTION
     The rsyncd protocol described in this relates to the BSD-licensed
     openrsync(1), a re-implementation of the GPL-licensed reference utility
     rsync(1).  It is compatible with version 27 of the reference.

     The rsyncd protocol is an envelope protocol for rsync(5) between a client
     and an rsync://-capable server.  It provides a means to exchange
     capabilities information prior to file transfer.

     In this document, "client" refers to the openrsync(1) utility making the
     request.  It follows that "server" refers to the daemon servicing the
     request.

     A connection between a client and server consists of host, a module, and
     zero or more paths.

           openrsync rsync://host/module/path1 rsync://host/path2... dest

     At this time, operating in sender mode (with the rsync:// host receiving
     information) is not described in this document.

   Data types
     These are the same as in rsync(5).  A newline is always a standalone \n.

   Client process
     After initialising a connection, the client and server exchange the
     following information, in order.  This portion of the process is not
     multiplexed.

     1.   client sends requested module followed by newline
     2.   server responds with preamble followed by standalone newline

     The requested module must have non-zero length.  The preamble consists in
     a sequence of lines.  Each line either contains free-form text sent by
     the server as a "motd" (message of the day) or a command:

           @RSYNCD: command\n

     The only supported command is the server protocol specification:

           @RSYNCD: xx[.yy]\n

     The optional component is the submodule, which may be discarded.  The
     version may only be specified once.  Both the motd and commands end in
     the special termination command:

           @RSYNCD: OK\n

     Following that, the client must send the command-line arguments that
     would otherwise be used to start a openrsync(1) server.  Each argument
     must be specified on its own line, e.g.,

           --server\n--sender\n-r\n-t\n.\npath1\npath2

     This must be followed by a standalone newline.

     If the server does not understand or accept any of the command-line
     arguments, it will exit at this point.

     Following this, the client must read the integer-length session checksum
     seed.  Multiplexing is subsequently enabled.

     The sequence that follows is stipulated in rsync(5) following the
     handshake.
