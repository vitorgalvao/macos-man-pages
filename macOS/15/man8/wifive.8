DESCRIPTION
     wifive is a tool for (1) performing connectivity, configuration, and
     environment diagnostics tests, (2) querying connection status, (3)
     configuring various networking-related logging facilities, (4) capturing
     Wi-Fi traffic, and (5) collecting logs for debugging Wi-Fi-related
     problems.

COMMANDS
     status

           Displays the current status for Wi-Fi and related components.

     diagnostics [--printTestIDs] [--timeout ⟨timeout⟩] [-t ⟨testID⟩]

           Runs diagnostics tests and displays the results.

     debug [--wifi ⟨0,1⟩] [--bluetooth ⟨0,1⟩] [--eapol ⟨0,1⟩] [--dns ⟨0,1⟩]

           Enables/disables debug logging for the specified components, or
           displays the current log configuration if no arguments are
           specified.

     logs [--printLogIDs] [--reason ⟨reason⟩] [--timeout ⟨timeout⟩] [-o
     ⟨outputDirectory⟩] [-z] [-l ⟨logID⟩]

           Collects logs and displays the output file path when completed.
           Specify -z to create a compressed archive.

           By default, on OS X devices the output directory is ~/Desktop and
           on iOS devices the output directory is /Library/Logs/CrashReporter.

     sniff [--channel ⟨channel⟩] --duration ⟨duration⟩ [-o ⟨outputDirectory⟩]

           Starts sniffing Wi-Fi traffic on the specified channel and displays
           the output file path when completed.

           By default, on OS X devices the output directory is ~/Desktop and
           on iOS devices the output directory is /Library/Logs/CrashReporter.

     events

           Starts event monitoring and displays the events as they are
           received.

           This command will block indefinitely, ue Ctl-C to stop monitoring
           events.

     wifiperf [--p2p] [--artrace] [--cc ⟨milliseconds⟩] [--powermetrics
     ⟨milliseconds⟩] [--wifistats ⟨seconds⟩]

           Starts Wi-Fi performance logging and displays the temporary output
           directory used for the current session.

           This command will block indefinitely, ue Ctl-C to stop the Wi-Fi
           performance monitoring session.

EXAMPLES
     Run default set of diagnostic tests:

           sudo wifive diagnostics

     Query debug log configuration:

           sudo wifive debug

     Enable Wi-Fi and EAPOL logging, and disable DNS logging:

           sudo wifive debug --eapol 1 --wifi 1 --dns 0

     Query status information:

           sudo wifive status

     Sniff Wi-Fi traffic on channel 36 for 20 seconds:

           sudo wifive sniff --channel 36 --duration 20
