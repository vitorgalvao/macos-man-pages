FSCK_MSDOS(8)               System Manager's Manual              FSCK_MSDOS(8)

NAME
     fsck_msdos – DOS/Windows (FAT) file system consistency check

SYNOPSIS
     fsck_msdos -q special ...
     fsck_msdos -p [-f] special ...
     fsck_msdos [-fny] special ...

DESCRIPTION
     The fsck_msdos utility verifies and repairs FAT file systems (more
     commonly known as DOS file systems).

     The first form of fsck_msdos quickly checks the specified file systems to
     determine whether they were cleanly unmounted.

     The second form of fsck_msdos preens the specified file systems.  It is
     normally started by fsck(8) run from /etc/rc.boot during automatic
     reboot, when a FAT file system is detected.  When preening file systems,
     fsck_msdos will fix common inconsistencies non-interactively.  If more
     serious problems are found, fsck_msdos does not try to fix them,
     indicates that it was not successful, and exits.

     The third form of fsck_msdos checks the specified file systems and tries
     to repair all detected inconsistencies, requesting confirmation before
     making any changes.  The default behavior is to always ask for
     confirmation of each change.  Use the -n or -y options to override this
     default behavior.

     The options are as follows:

           -q      Causes fsck_msdos to quickly check whether the volume was
                   unmounted cleanly.  If the volume was unmounted cleanly,
                   then the exit status is 0.  If the volume was not unmounted
                   cleanly, then the exit status will be non-zero.  In either
                   case, a message is printed to standard output describing
                   whether the volume was clean or dirty.

           -f      This option is ignored by fsck_msdos and is present only
                   for compatibility with programs that check other file
                   system types for consistency.

           -n      Causes fsck_msdos to assume no as the answer to all
                   operator questions, except “CONTINUE?”.

           -p      Preen the specified file systems.

           -y      Causes fsck_msdos to assume yes as the answer to all
                   operator questions.

           -M      Limits the amount of memory used by fsck_msdos.

           -S directory Causes fsck_msdos to create a shadow file containing
                   all metadata read from the device in the given directory.
                   This functionality is intended for inclusion with bug
                   reports regarding excpetional problems.  One file is
                   created for each checked device.  fsck_msdos may re-read
                   metadata from disk at different phases of the repair
                   process. If the repair process has repaired the metadata,
                   the shadow file will capture its state as last read from
                   disk. For optimal debug value, the shadow file should be
                   captured in conjunction with the -n option.  The shadow
                   file's name will be shadow-diskXsY or shadow-fd<X>, depends
                   on the information given to fsck_msdos.  If this file
                   already exists, fsck_msdos will attempt to add a counter
                   postfix to the name.  The resulting shadow file can be
                   mounted by diskimagetool.  Failure to generate or write to
                   the shadow file will not affect the behavior of fsck_msdos.


EXIT VALUES
     fsck_msdos exits with a value of 0 when the filesystem is clean (or has
     been repaired), and 8 otherwise.
