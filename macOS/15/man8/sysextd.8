NAME
     sysextd â€“ system extension manager

DESCRIPTION
     sysextd is a daemon that helps manage system extensions.  It works in
     coordination with other daemons, with system extensions' host

     not manually run sysextd; the daemon is automatically started when its
     services are needed.

FILES
     /Library/SystemExtensions
             System extensions and data managed by the daemon.

EXIT STATUS
     The sysextd utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
