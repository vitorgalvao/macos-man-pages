DOUBLEAGENTD(8)             System Manager's Manual            DOUBLEAGENTD(8)

NAME
     doubleagentd – A daemon for parsing AppleDouble files in userspace

SYNOPSIS
     doubleagentd takes no arguments, and users should not launch it manually.

DESCRIPTION
     doubleagentd receives requests from the kernel to parse AppleDouble files
     (and modify them, if needed).  AppleDouble files are used by file systems
     which do not natively support extended attributes, such as the MS-DOS and
     ExFAT file systems.

     doubleagentd is launched automatically by launchd(8) when the kernel
     needs to access an AppleDouble file that contains extended attributes for
     a base file.

FILES
     /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.doubleagentd.plist
