NAME
     systemextensionsctl – examine and manage system extensions

SYNOPSIS
     systemextensionsctl developer [on | off]
     systemextensionsctl list
     systemextensionsctl reset

DESCRIPTION
     The systemextensionsctl program examines and manages system extensions.

     Users should not run systemextensionsctl under most circumstances; this
     utility is intended for software developers.

     Its subcommands are:

     developer [on | off]
             Turn developer mode on and off.

             When the computer examines a new system extension, it performs a
             version check to see if it is the same as a system extension that
             is already installed.  When developer mode is on, this version
             check is skipped.

     list    List the system extensions and their state.  States include:

             activated enabled
                     Available for use

             activated waiting for user
                     Waiting for user approval via System Settings

             activated disabled
                     Available but currently disabled by the user, can be
                     enabled using System Settings

             terminated waiting for uninstall on reboot
                     Will be removed at the next computer restart

     reset   Forcibly reset system extensions.  This removes all system
             extensions and clears related state.

     The systemextensionsctl utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error
     occurs.
