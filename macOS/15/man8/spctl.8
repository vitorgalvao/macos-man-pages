SPCTL(8)                    System Manager's Manual                   SPCTL(8)

NAME
     spctl â€“ SecAssessment system policy security

SYNOPSIS
     spctl --assess [-t type] [-] file ...
     spctl --status
     spctl --global-enable
     spctl --global-disable | --disable-status

DESCRIPTION
     spctl manages the security assessment policy subsystem.

     This subsystem maintains and evaluates rules that determine whether the
     system allows the installation, execution, and other operations on files
     on the system.

     spctl requires one command option that determines its principal
     operation:

     -a, --assess
              Requests that spctl perform an assessment on the files given.

     --global-enable
              Enable the assessment subsystem.  Operations that are denied by
              system policy will fail; assessment APIs report the truth.
              Requires root access.

     --global-disable
              Reveal the option to allow applications downloaded from anywhere
              in the Privacy & Security settings pane.

     --disable-status
              Query whether the option to allow applications downloaded from
              anywhere in the Privacy & Security settings pane is available.

     --status
              Query whether the assessment subsystem is enabled or disabled.

     In addition, the following options are recognized:

     --continue
              If the assessment of a file fails, continue assessing additional
              file arguments.  Without this option, the first failed
              assessment terminates operation.

     --ignore-cache
              Do not query or use the assessment object cache.  This may
              significantly slow down operation.  Newly generated assessments
              may still be stored in the cache.

     --no-cache
              Do not place the outcome of any assessments into the assessment
              object cache.  No other assessment may reuse this outcome.  This
              option not prohibit the use of existing cache entries.

     --raw    When displaying the outcome of an assessment, write it as a
              "raw" XML plist instead of parsing it in somewhat more friendly
              form.  This is useful when used in scripts, or to access newly
              invented assessment aspects that spctl does not yet know about.

     -t, --type
              Specify which type of assessment is desired: execute to assess
              code execution, install to assess installation of an installer
              package, and open to assess the opening of documents.  The
              default is to assess execution.

     -v, --verbose
              Requests more verbose output.  Repeat the option or give it a
              higher numeric value to increase verbosity.

DEPRECATED OPTIONS
     As of MacOS 15.0, operations that modify the rule database or the global
     state of the assessment subsystem will no longer be supported.

     To add rules with configuration profiles, please see
     https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/systempolicyrule

     To modify the global state with configuration profiles, please see
     https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/systempolicycontrol

     --add    Add rule(s) to the system-wide assessment rule database.

     --disable
              Disable one or more rules in the assessment rule database.
              Disabled rules are not considered when performing assessment,
              but remain in the database and can be re-enabled later.

     --enable
              Enable rule(s) in the assessment rule database, counteracting
              earlier disabling.

     --remove
              Remove rule(s) from the assessment rule database.

     --reset-default
              Unconditionally reset the system policy database to its default
              value. This discards all changes made by administrators. It also
              heals any corruption to the database. It does not implicitly
              either enable or disable the facility. This must be done as the
              super user. Reboot after use.

     --anchor
              In rule update operations, indicates that the arguments are
              hashes of anchor certificates.

     --hash   In rule update operations, indicates that the arguments are code
              directory hashes.

     --label label
              Specifies a string label to attach to new rules, or find in
              existing rules.  Labels are arbitrary strings that are assigned
              by convention.  Rule labels are optional.

     --path   In rule update operations, indicates that the argument(s) denote
              paths to files on disk.

     --priority priority
              In rule update operations, specifies the priority of the rule(s)
              created or changed.  Priorities are floating-point numbers.
              Higher numeric values indicate higher priority.

     --requirement
              In rule update operations, indicates that the argument(s) are
              code requirement source.

     --rule   In rule update operations, indicates that the argument(s) are
              the index numbers of existing rules.

RULE SUBJECTS
     The system assessement rule database contains entries that match
     candidates based on Code Requirements.  spctl allows you to specify these
     requirements directly using the --requirement option.  In addition,
     individual programs on disk can be addressed with the --path option
     (which uses their Designated Requirement).  The --anchor option takes the
     hash of a (full) certificate and turns it into a requirement matching any
     signature based on that anchor certificate.  Alternatively, it can take
     the absolute path of a certificate file on disk, containing the DER form
     of an anchor certificate.  Finally, the --hash option generates a code
     requirement that denotes only and exactly one program whose CodeDirectory
     hash is given.  The means of specifying subjects does not affect the
     remaining processing.

FILES
     /var/db/SystemPolicyConfiguration/SystemPolicy           The system
                                                              policy database.
     /var/db/SystemPolicyConfiguration/.SystemPolicy-default  A copy of the

                                                              version of the
                                                              system policy
                                                              database.

                                                              starting over if
                                                              the database
                                                              gets messed up

EXAMPLES
     To check whether Mail.app is allowed to run on the local system:
           spctl -a /Applications/Mail.app
     To check whether the assessment subsystem is enabled:
           spctl --status

DIAGNOSTICS
     spctl exits zero on success, or one if an operation has failed.  Exit
     code two indicates unrecognized or unsuitable arguments.  If an
     assessment operation results in denial but no other problem has occurred,
     the exit code is three. Exit code four indicates the operation is now
     deprecated.
