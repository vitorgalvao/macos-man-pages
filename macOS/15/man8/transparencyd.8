NAME
     transparencyd – The transparency daemon.

DESCRIPTION
     transparencyd is a system daemon that verifies transparency information
     for identityservicesd and it's clients, like Messages.app.

     The “transparency” part of the name comes from the fact that there is a
     publicly auditable, verifiable, log-backed map data structure to ensure
     consistency of IDS/iMessage public keys.  the daemon performs automatic
     verification as part of the key transparency feature

     transparencyd is not intended to be invoked directly, but launchd though
     launchd.
