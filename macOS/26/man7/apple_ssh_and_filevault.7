apple_ssh_and_filevault(7)                    Miscellaneous Information Manual

NAME
     apple_ssh_and_filevault â€“ SSH and FileVault

DESCRIPTION
     When FileVault is enabled, the data volume is locked and unavailable
     during and after booting, until an account has been authenticated using a
     password.  The macOS version of OpenSSH stores all of its configuration
     files, both system-wide and per-account, in the data volume.  Therefore,
     the usually configured authentication methods and shell access are not
     available during this time.  However, when Remote Login is enabled, it is
     possible to perform password authentication using SSH even in this
     situation.  This can be used to unlock the data volume remotely over the
     network.  However, it does not immediately permit an SSH session.
     Instead, once the data volume has been unlocked using this method, macOS
     will disconnect SSH briefly while it completes mounting the data volume
     and starting the remaining services dependent on it.  Thereafter, SSH
     (and other enabled services) are fully available.

HISTORY
     The capability to unlock the data volume over SSH appeared in macOS 26
     Tahoe.
