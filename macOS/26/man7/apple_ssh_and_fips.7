NAME
     apple_ssh_and_fips – Configuring SSH for FIPS algorithms

DESCRIPTION
     The macOS version of OpenSSH uses Apple’s FIPS Cryptographic Modules for
     FIPS 140-2 validated algorithms, automatically without the need for
     installation, administration, or configuration.  To restrict the SSH
     client and server to use only FIPS algorithms, customize the
     configuration as directed below.

     The configuration files for ssh(1) and sshd(8) read the algorithm
     configuration directives from /etc/ssh/crypto.conf, which should be a
     symbolic link to either the macOS default algorithm configuration file
     /etc/ssh/crypto/apple.conf, or to the FIPS-only configuration file
     /etc/ssh/crypto/fips.conf.  To choose FIPS algorithms only, update the
     symbolic link as follows.

           sudo ln -fs crypto/fips.conf /etc/ssh/crypto.conf

     To return to the default set of algorithms which largely prefer FIPS
     algorithms but allow others as well:

           sudo ln -fs crypto/apple.conf /etc/ssh/crypto.conf

HISTORY
     /etc/ssh/crypto.conf, /etc/ssh/crypto/apple.conf, and
     /etc/ssh/crypto/fips.conf appeared in macOS 15 Sequoia.

CAVEATS
     When upgrading from a previous version of macOS, the OpenSSH
     configuration directory /etc/ssh is preserved.  Thus, when upgrading from
     versions prior to macOS 15 Sequoia, the files mentioned in this manual
     page may not be present.  To reset the OpenSSH configuration to macOS
     defaults, run the following command:

           sudo /usr/libexec/reset-ssh-configuration

     WARNING: The above command will discard the existing configuration with
     the exception of host keys.
