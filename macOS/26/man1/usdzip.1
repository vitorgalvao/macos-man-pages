usdzip()                                                              usdzip()




NAME
       usdzip - Utility for creating a .usdz file containing USD assets and
       for inspecting existing .usdz files.

SYNOPSIS
       usdzip [output.usdz]

DESCRIPTION
       usdzip is a utility that is useful for creating USDZ packages from a
       set of input files.



       -h, --help
              Prints out a help message and exits.


       -r, --recurse
              If specified, files in sub-directories are recursively added to
              the package.


       -a, --asset [ASSET]
              Resolvable asset path pointing to the root layer of the asset to
              be isolated and copied into the package.


       -arkitAsset [ASSET]
              Similar to the --asset option, the --arkitAsset option packages
              all of the dependencies of the named scene file. Assets targeted
              at the initial usdz implementation in RealityKit operate under
              greater constraints than usdz files for more general 'in house'
              uses, and this option attempts to ensure that these constraints
              are honored; this may involve more transformations to the data,
              which may cause loss of features such as VariantSets.


       -c, --checkCompliance
              Perform compliance checking of the input files. If the input
              asset or "root" layer fails any of the compliance checks, the
              package is not created and the program fails.


       -l, --list [FILE]
              List contents of the specified usdz file. If a file- path
              argument is provided, the list is output to a file at the given
              path. If no argument is provided or if '-' is specified as the
              argument, the list is output to stdout.


       -d, --dump [FILE]
              Dump contents of the specified usdz file. If a file- path
              argument is provided, the contents are output to a file at the
              given path. If no argument is provided or if '-' is specified as
              the argument, the contents are output to stdout.


       --version
              Display program version information and exits.



EXAMPLES
       usdzip output.usdz --asset input.usd
              Creates a USDZ file with input.usd as the entry point.  usdzip
              will try and find all used resources and include them in the
              resulting package.

                                                                      usdzip()
