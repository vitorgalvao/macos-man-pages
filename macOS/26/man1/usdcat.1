USDCAT()                                                              USDCAT()




NAME
       usdcat - Write usd file(s) either as text to stdout or to a specified
       output file.

SYNOPSIS
       usdcat [inputFiles]

DESCRIPTION
       usdcat is a utility that is used to convert the contents of input files
       to other supported formats, or display them as text to stdout.


       -h, --help
              Prints out a help message and exits


       -o, --output
              Write a single input file to this output file instead of stdout.


       --usdFormat [usda | usdc]
              Use this underlying file format for output files with the
              extension 'usd'. For example, passing output.usd as a text file.
              The USD_DEFAULT_FILE_FORMAT environment variable is another way
              to achieve this.


       -l, --loadOnly
              Attempt to load the specified input files and report 'OK' or
              'ERR' for each one. After all files are processed, this script
              will exit with a non-zero exit code if any files failed to load.


       -f, --flatten
              Compose stages with the input files as root layers


       --flattenLayerStack
              Flatten the layer stack with the given root layer, and write out
              the results. Unlike --flatten, this does not flatten composition
              arcs (such as references).


       --skipSourceFileComment
              If --flatten is specified, skip adding a comment regarding the
              source of the flattened layer in the documentation field of the
              output layer.


       --mask [PRIMPATH...]
              Limit stage population to these prims, their descendants and
              ancestors. To specify multiple paths, either use commas with no
              spaces, or quote the argument and separate paths by commas
              and/or spaces. Requires --flatten.


       --layerMetadata
              Load only layer metadata in the USD file.  This option cannot be
              combined with either --flatten or --flattenLayerStack.


       --version
              Display program version information and exit.


NOTES
       The multi-file input to usdcat does not perform any kind of merge of
       the content in the separate
              files (and there is no such utility to do so,yet… parameterizing
              that problem is an interesting challenge!); it simply dumps the
              contents of each file, sequentially.


       The --flatten option uses the stage Export , which, as one might
       expect,
              “bakes in” the effects of all composition operators,
              simultaneously removing the operators themselves, in the result;
              this applies both to namespace operators like references,
              sublayers, and variants, and also to value-resolution operators
              like layer and reference time offsets.  Flattening a stage does
              preserve USD native instancing by flattening each prototype into
              the generated layer and adding references on each instance to
              its corresponding prototype.  Thus, the exported data may appear
              structurally different than in the participating source files,
              but should evaluate/compute identically to that of the source
              files.


EXAMPLES
       usdcat input.usd
              Displays the contents of input.usd as a USDA representation.


       usdcat input.usd --flatten
              Displays the contents of input.usd as a USDA representation.
              All composition is flattened.


       usdcat input.usda -o output.usdc
              Converts input.usda to output.usdc.

                                                                      USDCAT()
