USDTREE()                                                            USDTREE()




NAME
       usdtree - Utility to display the structure of the USD file as a tree in
       the terminal.

SYNOPSIS
       usdtree [inputFiles]

DESCRIPTION
       usdtree traverses the hierarchy in a given USD stage or layer, and
       displays the structure.

       The default mode inspects the single USD file provided.  Use the
       --flatten argument to see the flattened composed Stage tree instead.

       Special metadata like kind and active are always shown if authored
       unless --simple is provided.



       -h, --help
              Prints out a help message and exits.


       --unloaded
              Payloads are not loaded when this is specified.


       -a, --attributes
              Display authored attributes.


       -m, --metadata
              Display authored metadata.  Active and Kind are part of the
              label and not shown as individual items.


       -s, --simple
              Only display prim names: no specifier, kind or active state.


       -f, --flatten
              Compose the stage with the input file as the root layer and
              write the flattened content.


       --flattenLayerStack
              Flatten the layer stack with the given root layer. Unlike
              --flatten, this does not flatten composition arcs (such as
              references).


       --mask [PRIMPATHS]
              Limit stage population to these prims, their descendants and
              ancestors. To specify multiple paths, either use commas with no
              spaces, or quote the argument and separate paths by commas
              and/or spaces. Requires --flatten.


       --version
              Display program version information and exits.



EXAMPLES
       usdtree input.usdz --attributes --metadata --flatten
              Displays the structure of the flattened input USDZ, including
              all attributes and metadata.

                                                                     USDTREE()
