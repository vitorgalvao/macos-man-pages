avbcapture(1)               General Commands Manual              avbcapture(1)

NAME
     avbcapture â€“ Audio Video Bridging traffic capture tool.

SYNOPSIS
     avbcapture command <arguments>

DESCRIPTION
     The avbcapture executable is used for capturing a PCAPNG file containing
     gPTP and AVTP stream packets.


     The following options are available for the pcap command:

     --interface bsd-name
         The interface to capture traffic on. This option may be provided
         multiple times to capture simultaneously from multiple interfaces to
         the one file.

     --output path
         Specifies the path to the PCAPNG file to put all the captured
         traffic.

     --ring
         Use a ring of packets and only output to file when the capture is
         stopped.

     --length num-packets
         The number of packets to keep in the ring. Defaults to 2,561,000 if
         not specified.

     --allow-tap
         Allow the tool to tap the receive queue rather than adding a stream
         capture allowing capture on a live system. This could potentially
         cause performance issues resulting in packets being lost.

     --force-tap
         Force using the receive queue rather than adding a stream capture
         allowing capture on a live system. This could potentially cause
         performance issues resulting in packets being lost.
