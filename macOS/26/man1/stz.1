NAME
     stz â€“ Manipulate Streamable Archives

SYNOPSIS
     stz extract [[-hash-type hash-type] --hash-size hash-size-in-bytes
         --hashes-file hashes-file] input-path output-path

DESCRIPTION
     This utility may be used to manipulate streamable archives.

   EXTRACT COMMAND
     The extract form extracts a streamable archive.  The hash arguments are
     optional, but if used provide a convenient way to verify the integrity of
     the archive during extraction.

     --hash-type hash-type
             Set the hash type for verification.  One of: MD5 SHA1 SHA224
             SHA256 SHA384 SHA512

             The default is SHA256.

     --hash-size hash-size-in-bytes
             Hash the archive's contents over each given byte-sized interval
             and verify those hashes as the archive is streamed.

             Disabled if 0 or not specified, otherwise requires --hashes-file.
             Verify the entire file using a single hash if the string full is
             given as the hash size.

     --hashes-file hashes-file
             Path to UTF8-encoded file containing the hashes, in order and one
             line per hash value, of each chunk.

     input-path
             Path to streamable archive to extract.

     output-path
             Path of directory to create into which the contents of the
             archive will be extracted.  The past must not already exist.

EXIT STATUS
     The stz utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
