usdrecord()                                                        usdrecord()




NAME
       usdrecord - Utility for generating images from a USD file.

SYNOPSIS
       usdrecord [inputFile] [outputImage]

DESCRIPTION
       usdrecord is a command-line utility for generating images (or sequences
       of images) of a USD stage.



       -h, --help
              Prints out a help message and exits.


       --mask [PRIMPATH]
              Limit stage population to these prims, their descendants and
              ancestors. To specify multiple paths, either use commas with no
              spaces or quote the argument and separate paths by commas and/or
              spaces.


       --purposes [PURPOSE]
              Specify which UsdGeomImageable purposes should be included in
              the renders.  The "default" purpose is automatically included,
              so you need specify only the *additional* purposes.  If you want
              more than one extra purpose, either use commas with no spaces or
              quote the argument and separate purposes by commas and/or
              spaces.


       --sessionLayer [SESSION_LAYER]
              If specified, the stage will be opened with the 'sessionLayer'
              in place of the default anonymous layer.


       --disableGpu
              Indicates if the GPU should not be used for rendering.  If set
              this not only restricts renderers to those which only run on the
              CPU, but additionally it will prevent any tasks that require the
              GPU from being invoked


       --disableCameraLight
              Indicates if the default camera lights should not be used for
              rendering.


       --cam, --camera [Camera Path]
              Which camera to use - may be given as either just the camera's
              prim name (i.e. just the last element in the prim path), or as a
              full prim path.  Note that if only the prim name is used and
              more than one camera exists with that name, which one is used
              will effectively be random.


       -d, --defaultTime
              Explicitly operate at the Default time code (the default
              behavior is to operate at the Earliest time code).  Cannot be
              used with --frames


       -f, --frames [FRAMES]
              Specify FrameSpec(s) of the time codes to operate on.  A
              FrameSpec consists of up to three floating point values for the
              start time code, end time code, and stride of a time code range.
              A single time code can be specified, or a start and end time
              code can be specified separated by a colon (:).  When a start
              and end time code are specified, the stride may optionally be
              specified as well, separating it from the start and end time
              codes with (x). Multiple FrameSpecs can be combined as a comma-
              separated list.  The following are examples of valid FrameSpecs:
              123 - 101:105 - 105:101 - 101:109x2 - 101:110x2 - 101:104x0.5


       -c, --complexity [low|medium|high|veryhigh]
              The level of refinement to use. Low is the default.


       -r, --renderer [RENDERER]
              Hydra renderer plugin to use when generating images. The default
              is Storm using Metal.


       -w, --imageWidth [WIDTH]
              The width of the output image. The height will be computed from
              this value and the camera's aspect ratio.  Defaults to 960
              pixels wide.


       --enableDomeLightVisibility, --domeLightCameraVisibility
              Show the dome light background in the rendered output.  If this
              option is not included and there is a dome light in the stage,
              the IBL from it will be used but the background will be
              transparent.


       --rp, --renderPassPrimPath [PATH]
              Specify the Render Pass Prim to use to render the given usdFile.
              Note that if a renderSettingsPrimPath has been specified in the
              stage metadata, using this argument will override that opinion.
              Furthermore any properties authored on the RenderSettings will
              override other arguments (imageWidth, camera, outputImagePath)


       --rs, --renderSettingsPrimPath [PATH]
              Specifies the Render Settings Prim to use to render the given
              usdFile.  Note that if a renderSettingsPrimPath has been
              specified in the stage metadata, using this argument will
              override that opinion. Furthermore any properties authored on
              the RenderSettings will override other arguments (imageWidth,
              camera, outputImagePath)


       --version
              Display program version information and exits.



EXAMPLES
       usdrecord input.usdz output.png
              Renders the input usdz file to an output png.

                                                                   usdrecord()
