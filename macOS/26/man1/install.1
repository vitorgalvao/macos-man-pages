DESCRIPTION
     The file(s) are copied (or linked if the -l option is specified) to the
     target file or directory.  If the destination is a directory, then the
     file is copied into directory with its original filename.  If the target
     file already exists, it is either renamed to file.old if the -b option is
     given or overwritten if permissions allow.  An alternate backup suffix
     may be specified via the -B option's argument.

     The options are as follows:

     -B suffix
             Use suffix as the backup suffix if -b is given.

     -b      Back up any existing files before overwriting them by renaming
             them to file.old.  See -B for specifying a different backup
             suffix.

     -C      Copy the file.  If the target file already exists and the files
             are the same, then do not change the modification time of the
             target.  If the target's file flags and mode need not to be
             changed, the target's inode change time is also unchanged.

     -c      Copy the file.  This is actually the default.  The -c option is
             only included for backwards compatibility.

     -D destdir
             Specify the DESTDIR (top of the file hierarchy) that the items
             are installed in to.  If -M metalog is in use, a leading string
             of “destdir” will be removed from the file names logged to the
             metalog.  This option does not affect where the actual files are
             installed.

     -d      Create directories.  Missing parent directories are created as
             required.

     -f flags
             Specify the target's file flags; see chflags(1) for a list of
             possible flags and their meanings.

     -g group
             Specify a group.  A numeric GID is allowed.

     -h hash
             When copying, calculate the digest of the files with hash to
             store in the -M metalog.  When -d is given no hash is emitted.
             Supported digests:

                   none    No hash.  This is the default.

                   sha1    The SHA-1 cryptographic message digest.

                   sha256  The 256-bits SHA-2 cryptographic message digest of
                           the file.

                   sha512  The 512-bits SHA-2 cryptographic message digest of
                           the file.

     -l linkflags
             Instead of copying the file make a link to the source.  The type
             of the link is determined by the linkflags argument.  Valid
             linkflags are: a (absolute), r (relative), h (hard), s
             (symbolic), m (mixed).  Absolute and relative have effect only
             for symbolic links.  Mixed links are hard links for files on the
             same filesystem, symbolic otherwise.

     -M metalog
             Write the metadata associated with each item installed to metalog
             in an mtree(8) “full path” specification line.  The metadata
             includes: the file name and file type, and depending upon other
             options, the owner, group, file flags, modification time, and
             tags.

     -m mode
             Specify an alternate mode.  The default mode is set to rwxr-xr-x
             (0755).  The specified mode may be either an octal or symbolic
             value; see chmod(1) for a description of possible mode values.

     -o owner
             Specify an owner.  A numeric UID is allowed.

     -p      Preserve the access and modification times.  Copy the file, as if
             the -C (compare and copy) option is specified, except if the
             target file does not already exist or is different, then preserve
             the access and modification times of the source file.

     -S      Flush each file to disk after copying.  This has a non-negligible
             impact on performance, but reduces the risk of being left with a
             partial file if the system crashes or loses power shortly after
             install runs.

             Historically, -S also enabled the use of temporary files to
             ensure atomicity when replacing an existing target.  Temporary
             files are no longer optional.

     -s      install exec's the command strip(1) to strip binaries so that
             install can be portable over a large number of systems and binary
             types.  See below for how install can be instructed to use
             another program to strip binaries.

     -T tags
             Specify the mtree(8) tags to write out for the file when using -M
             metalog.

     -U      Indicate that install is running unprivileged, and that it should
             not try to change the owner, the group, or the file flags of the
             destination.  The information that would have been updated can be
             stored in a log file with -M metalog.

     -v      Cause install to be verbose, showing files as they are installed
             or backed up.

     By default, install preserves all file flags, with the exception of the
     “nodump” flag.

     The install utility attempts to prevent moving a file onto itself.

     Installing /dev/null creates an empty file.

ENVIRONMENT
     The install utility checks for the presence of the STRIPBIN environment
     variable and if present, uses the assigned value as the program to run if
     and when the -s option has been specified.

     If the DONTSTRIP environment variable is present, install will ignore any
     specification of the -s option.

FILES
     INS@XXXXXX  Temporary files named INS@XXXXXX, where XXXXXX is decided by
                 mkstemp(3), are created in the target directory.

EXIT STATUS
     The install utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

COMPATIBILITY
     Historically install moved files by default.  The default was changed to
     copy in FreeBSD 4.4.

SEE ALSO
     chflags(1), chgrp(1), chmod(1), cp(1), mv(1), strip(1), getgrnam(3),
     getpwnam(3), chown(8)

HISTORY
     The install utility appeared in 4.2BSD.

BUGS
     The meaning of the -M option has changed as of FreeBSD 9.2 and it now
     takes an argument.  Command lines that used the old -M will get an error
     or in rare cases will append logs to the first of multiple source files
     rather than installing it.

     Temporary files may be left in the target directory if install exits
     abnormally.

     File flags cannot be set by fchflags(2) over a NFS file system.  Other
     file systems do not have a concept of flags.  The install utility will
     only warn when flags could not be set on a file system that does not
     support them.

     The install utility with -v falsely says a file is copied when -C snaps
     hard links.
