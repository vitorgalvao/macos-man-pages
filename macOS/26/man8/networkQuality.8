NAME
     networkQuality â€“ Network quality testing tool

SYNOPSIS
     networkQuality [-bdhksuv] [-B Bonjour name] [-C configuration URL]
                    [-c filename] [-f protocol selection] [-I interface]
                    [-M max run time] [-r host] [-S port]

DESCRIPTION
     networkQuality allows for measuring the different aspects of Network
     Quality, including:

     Maximal capacity (often described as speed)

     The responsiveness of the connection. Responsiveness measures the quality
     of your network by the number of roundtrips completed per minute (RPM)
     under working conditions. See https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212313

     Other aspects of the connection that affect the quality of experience.

     NOTE: This tool will connect to the Internet to perform its tests. This
     will use data on your Internet service plan.

     For more details about the RPM score and the methodology around the
     testing, see
     https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-cpaasch-ippm-responsiveness/

     The following options are available:

     -b       Show Bonjour advertised networkQuality servers

     -B Bonjour name
              Run against specified Bonjour instance

     -C configuration URL/path
              Use custom configuration URL or path (with scheme file://). See
              https://github.com/network-quality/server for server
              implementation details.

     -f <option[,<option>,...]>
              Force usage of a specific protocol selection:
                 h1: To enforce HTTP/1.1
                 h2: To enforce HTTP/2
                 h3: To enforce HTTP/3 (QUIC)
                 L4S: To force-enable L4S
                 noL4S: To force-disable L4S

     -I interface
              Bind test to interface (e.g., en0, pdp_ip0,...)

              If not specified, the default interface will be used.

     -M max run time
              Maximum runtime in seconds

     -r host  Connect to host or IP, overriding DNS for initial config request

     -S port  Create a networkQuality server-instance running locally on the
              specified port.  It will display the URL of the config-file that
              can be passed on to a client-instance with option -C. Note that
              the certificate is self-signed and thus option -k needs to be
              used on the client-instance.

     -c [filename]
              Produce computer-readable output (JSON). filename is optional,
              will default to STDOUT.

     -d       Do not run a download test (implies -s)

     -h       Show help

     -k       Disable verification of the server identity via TLS.

     -p       Use iCloud Private Relay.

     -s       Run tests sequentially instead of parallel upload/download.

     -u       Do not run an upload test (implies -s)

     -v       Verbose output.
