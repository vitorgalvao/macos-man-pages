NAME
     nlcontrol â€“ NETLOGON secure channel utility

SYNOPSIS
     nlcontrol [options] reconfigure
     nlcontrol [options] status
     nlcontrol [options] verify
     nlcontrol [options] change-password

DESCRIPTION
     The NETLOGON channel is a secure connection to a Windows Domain
     Controller that is used for non-Kerberos user authentication.  nlcontrol
     can be used to manipulate and test the status of the NETLOGON channel.

OPTIONS
     -domain  Domain name.

     -help    Prints a usage message and exits.

     -server  Server name.

     nlcontrol supports the following commands:

     reconfigure      Force the NETLOGON service to re-read its configuration
                      information. This is not necessary in normal operation,
                      since the NETLOGON service will detect relevant
                      configuration changes and re-establish the secure
                      channel automatically.

     status           Print the current status of the NETLOGON channel without
                      altering its state.

     verify           Attempt to verify that the NETLOGON channel is available
                      and working correctly.

     change-password  Bring up the NETLOGON channel and change the password of
                      the machine account.  The machine account is used to
                      authenticate to the Domain Controller in order to secure
                      the channel.

DIAGNOSTICS
     nlcontrol will exit with a non-zero error code if the command fails. It
     may also display a Windows error code, which is typically self-
     explanatory.

HISTORY
     The nlcontrol utility first appeared in Mac OS 10.7.
