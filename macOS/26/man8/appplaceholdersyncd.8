NAME
     appplaceholdersyncd â€“ Agent which syncs app info between devices.

DESCRIPTION
     appplaceholdersyncd This agent exists to support showing icons of apps
     installed on other devices owned by the user. It syncs a minimally-sized
     "placeholder" to provide enough info for registering the app with
     LaunchServices and for rendering the app's icon.

     This command provides a system service and is not intended to be invoked
     directly.
