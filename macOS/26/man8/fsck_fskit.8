FSCK_FSKIT(8)               System Manager's Manual              FSCK_FSKIT(8)

NAME
     fsck_fskit â€“ file system consistency check and interactive repair for
     FSKit

SYNOPSYS
     fsck_fskit [--progress] -t fstype [module_options] resource

DESCRIPTION
     The fsck_fskit utility verifies and repairs FSKit file systems.

     The options are as follows:

     --progress  causes fsck_fskit to display a progres bar during the repair
                 or verify operation.

     -t fstype   Use the FSKit Module named fstype to perform the repair or
                 verify operation.

     module_options Any options supplied as module_options are passed to the
                 file system module as part of the operation.  The valid
                 syntax for these options is set by the specified module.

     If the selected module's syntax supports a -t option, it is possible for
     a command invocation to have multiple -t instances. The first instance
     must follow the syntax here and include the fstype.  The second may
     appear anywhere within the module_options and follow the syntax of the
     module.

RESOURCE
     FSModules use different storage and connection technologies as the basis
     for file systems. FSKit uses the term Resource to cover this variety.
     FSKit recognizes three categories of resources:

     Block Device  This category covers traditional disk drives and
                   partitions. An example resource of this kind is:
                   /dev/disk2s1 or /dev/rdisk2s1.  FSKit does not
                   differentiate between block and raw disk semantics.
                   diskarbitrationd(8) can automatically mount file systems
                   which use these resources.

     Path URL      This category covers a file system using a pre-existing
                   volume as its data storage. Additionally, the fsck_fskit
                   command shares path access privileges with the FSModule.
                   An example resource of this kind is:
                   file:///private/tmp/workdir

     Generic URL   This category covers file systems using other connection
                   technologies. The structure of these resources is that they
                   are URLs following a scheme specific to the file system.
